# DeepQA-with-Pytorch

This project aims to reimplement the work "Deep Learning of Human Visual Sensitivity in Image Quality Assessment Framework" for FR-IQA on PyTorch platform. The code has been trained and tested on LIVE and TID2013 database. The current performance is close to the claimed performance in the original paper. 

## File structure

This project folder should be included in a upper directory with the database data as following:

'--mother folder'

'----data'

'------LIVE_dataset'

'------TID2013_dataset'

'----this code'
